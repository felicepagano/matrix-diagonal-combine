**Matrix unraveling**

Given an m x n matrix of characters, write a method that returns a String which
contains the concatenation of all the matrix’s diagonals, from top to bottom,
right to left.

For example, input


`1 A 5 7 B N`

`2 B 6 8 K R`

`5 Q N 3 B 1`


Output has to be: `1 A2 5B5 76Q B8N NK3 RB 1` as a result (with or
without spaces, doesn’t matter)
